    <h2>Why Anime is amazing!!!</h2>
    <h4>September 4, 2022 by Romario Crosbie</h4>
    <img src= "sukana.jpg" class="image1">
    <p>When most people think of anime, they see it as childish, weird, and 
       something only freaks are interested in. But when you and me think of anime? 
       We see anime for what it is. And there’s a good reason as to 
       why we do since we’re part of the industry. You can’t challenge anime 
       when it comes to visuals. Why? Because that’s the point. Before anything else 
       and all the other things that make anime great, visuals is what makes anime so 
       unique and fresh. We all know of comedy shows like American TV show: Friends. But 
       you can never compare regular comedy to the comedy seen in anime. Because animation 
       allows you to do things regular shows can’t. Like the stupidly funny faces characters pull. Or 
       the ridiculous effects studios are able to throw in to add context to the humour.</p>

    <p>The thing with regular TV shows and films is: there’s only so much.Sure there’s comedy, 
       thriller, supernatural (Spiderman), horror and things of that nature. But if you compare  
       it side by side to anime, it’s pitiful.
       Anime has too many genres to name, and even more topics each anime.
       The anime industry is still in its startup phase. That means studios, many employees, 
       artists and mangaka’s have it harder than most.
       It’s a hard industry only the most committed are able to break into.
       What’s that got to do with creativity? Everything.
       So many anime studios have less money to work with compared to Hollywood, 
       or western entertainment companies in general.</p>
